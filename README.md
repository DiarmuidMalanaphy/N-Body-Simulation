This N-Body Particle Simulation models the gravitational interactions between n particles. The project focuses on efficient 3D rendering and accurate representation of the particle movement.

I built this as an experiment, to learn OpenGL and how to structure a C++ project. The simulation is written in C++ to handle large numbers of particles and uses state of the art algorithms like Barnes-Hut to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

Because it's such a pain to set-up OpenGL from scratch, I've provided a video of me running the program (ignore my desktop).
